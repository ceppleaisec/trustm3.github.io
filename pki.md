# PKI
<img alt="trustme pki architecture" src="img/pki_trustm3.png" width="55%">

The illustration gives an overview of a possible PKI solution for trust\|me,
which we will describe in more detail soon.
A development PKI instantiation (not intended for productive use) is automatically generated at build time.

### Build development PKI manually from trust\|me source
```
bash ws-yocto/trustme/build/device_provisioning/gen_dev_certs.sh
```
